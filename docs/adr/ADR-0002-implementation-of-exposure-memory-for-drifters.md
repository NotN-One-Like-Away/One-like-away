# ADR-0002: Implementation of Exposure Memory for Drifters

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to simulate the real echo-chamber mechanism, where repeated exposure to topics builds familiarity and preference

## Decision
Introduced drifterExposure, an in-memory exposure memory that tracks which topics a drifter has been shown by the recommendation algorithm

## Consequences

### Positive
- More realistic simulation of echo chambers
- Improved drifter behavior

### Negative
- Increased complexity in the drifter liking process

### Risks
- Potential for exposure memory to become outdated or inconsistent

## Alternatives Considered
- **Not implementing exposure memory and relying solely on likes to build drifter preferences**: This approach would not effectively simulate the echo-chamber mechanism and would result in less realistic drifter behavior

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
