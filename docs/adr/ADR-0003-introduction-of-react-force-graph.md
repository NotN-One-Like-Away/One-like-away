# ADR-0003: Introduction of React Force Graph

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need for a graph visualization library

## Decision
Use React Force Graph as the graph visualization library

## Consequences

### Positive
- Easy to use and customize
- Good performance and scalability

### Negative
- Limited features and customization options
- Potential for compatibility issues

### Risks
- Dependence on a third-party library
- Potential for bugs and errors

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a different graph visualization library like D3.js or Sigma.js**: React Force Graph's ease of use and performance were more suitable for the project
- **Use a custom graph visualization solution**: Increased development time and complexity

## Files Involved
- `package-lock.json`
- `package.json`
- `src/components/Graph.tsx`
