# ADR-0001: Introduction of Vercel Configuration

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to configure Vercel for the project, likely for deployment or routing purposes

## Decision
To introduce a Vercel configuration file (vercel.json) with a rewrite rule

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simplified routing configuration
- Improved deployment flexibility

### Negative
- Potential for misconfigured routing
- Additional dependency on Vercel

### Risks
- Incompatibility with existing routing configurations
- Security vulnerabilities in Vercel configuration

## Alternatives Considered
- **Using a different deployment platform**: Vercel's features and ease of use likely outweighed alternatives
- **Manual routing configuration without Vercel**: Increased complexity and maintenance burden

## Files Involved
- `vercel.json`
