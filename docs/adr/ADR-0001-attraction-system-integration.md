# ADR-0001: Attraction System Integration

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to integrate attraction scores into the graph physics to create a more realistic and dynamic user interaction model

## Decision
Implement an attraction system that materializes attraction scores based on likes, exposure, and bot posts, and integrate it with the graph physics

## Consequences

### Positive
- More realistic and dynamic user interaction model
- Emergent clustering and measurable polarization
- Ability to track and analyze user behavior and attraction scores

### Negative
- Increased complexity in the system
- Potential performance issues with the attraction table and RPC functions

### Risks
- Difficulty in balancing the attraction scores and graph physics
- Potential for unintended consequences or biases in the attraction system

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a simpler clustering algorithm**: Would not capture the complexity and nuance of user interactions and attraction scores
- **Use a pre-existing library or framework for attraction and graph physics**: Would not provide the level of customization and control needed for the specific use case

## Files Involved
- `docs/ATTRACTION-INTEGRATION.md`
- `src/components/ComposePost.tsx`
- `src/components/Post.tsx`
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
- `supabase/attraction-setup.sql`
