- More accurate attraction scores and graph physics

### Negative
- Increased complexity in the user promotion process

### Risks
- Difficulty in handling and processing user promotion and attraction history transfer
- Potential for errors or inconsistencies in the attraction scores and graph physics

## Alternatives Considered
- **Do not promote demo users or transfer attraction history**: Would not provide a seamless and accurate user experience
