# ADR-0001: Introduction of Drifter Bots

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to simulate user interactions and create a more dynamic environment led to the introduction of drifter bots.

## Decision
Implement drifter bots that can interact with the system, like posts, and have a limited lifespan.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Increased user engagement
- More realistic simulation of user interactions
- Ability to test and refine the system's recommendation algorithm

### Negative
- Potential for drifter bots to skew system metrics
- Additional complexity in the system
- Need for ongoing maintenance and tuning of drifter bot behavior

### Risks
- Drifter bots may not accurately represent real user behavior
- System may become overly reliant on drifter bots for engagement

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use historical user data to simulate interactions**: May not accurately represent current user behavior and may not be dynamic enough

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
