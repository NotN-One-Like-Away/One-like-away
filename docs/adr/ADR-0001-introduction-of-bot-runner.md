# ADR-0001: Introduction of Bot Runner

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need for automated bot activity to simulate user interactions and generate content

## Decision
Implement a bot runner that utilizes predefined personas to create and post content

## Consequences

### Positive
- Increased engagement and activity on the platform
- More diverse and dynamic content generation

### Negative
- Potential for spam or low-quality content
- Increased load on the server and database

### Risks
- Overwhelming the platform with automated content
- Difficulty in distinguishing between real and automated user activity

## Alternatives Considered
- **Manual content creation and posting**: Time-consuming and labor-intensive, may not be scalable
- **Using existing bot libraries or frameworks**: May not provide the desired level of customization and control

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
- `src/pages/Graph.tsx`
- `supabase/functions/generate-bot-post/index.ts`
