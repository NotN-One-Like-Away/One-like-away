# ADR-0002: Use of TypeScript as Programming Language

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Need for a type-safe and maintainable programming language

## Decision
Use TypeScript as the programming language

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved code maintainability
- Better type safety

### Negative
- Steeper learning curve for new developers
- Potential performance issues with complex types

### Risks
- Dependence on TypeScript's ecosystem
- Potential compatibility issues with existing libraries

## Alternatives Considered
- **JavaScript**: Less type safety and maintainability
- **Flow**: Less mature ecosystem and fewer integrations available

## Files Involved
- `tsconfig.json`
- `src/**/*`
