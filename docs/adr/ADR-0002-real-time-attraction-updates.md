# ADR-0002: Real-time Attraction Updates

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to update attraction scores in real-time to reflect changes in user behavior and interactions

## Decision
Use a real-time subscription to update attraction scores and graph physics

## Consequences

### Positive
- More accurate and up-to-date attraction scores and graph physics
- Improved user experience and interaction model

### Negative
- Increased complexity and potential performance issues with real-time updates

### Risks
- Difficulty in handling and processing real-time updates
- Potential for errors or inconsistencies in the attraction scores and graph physics

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a batch update process**: Would not provide the level of timeliness and accuracy needed for the attraction system

## Files Involved
- `docs/ATTRACTION-INTEGRATION.md`
- `src/components/Post.tsx`
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
