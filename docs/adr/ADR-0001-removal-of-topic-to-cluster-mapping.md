# ADR-0001: Removal of TOPIC_TO_CLUSTER mapping

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The code change removed a large mapping of topics to clusters, suggesting a shift in how topics are categorized or processed.

## Decision
Removed the TOPIC_TO_CLUSTER mapping, potentially simplifying or altering the topic clustering logic.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced code complexity
- Potential for more dynamic topic clustering

### Negative
- Loss of explicit topic-to-cluster mappings
- Potential disruption to existing topic clustering functionality

### Risks
- Incorrect or incomplete topic clustering
- Impact on downstream components relying on topic clustering

## Alternatives Considered
- **Refactor the mapping to a more dynamic or data-driven approach**: Not chosen in this commit, but could be a future improvement

## Files Involved
- `src/pages/Graph.tsx`
