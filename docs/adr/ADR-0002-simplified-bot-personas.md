# ADR-0002: Simplified Bot Personas

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The system had multiple bot personas with complex topic preferences. This made it difficult to manage and update the personas.

## Decision
Simplify the bot personas by using canonical topics only, reducing the complexity of the personas and making them easier to manage.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Easier management of bot personas
- Reduced complexity in the botRunner.ts file

### Negative
- Potential loss of nuance in bot personas

### Risks
- Potential for decreased realism in bot interactions

## Alternatives Considered
- **Keep the complex topic preferences for bot personas**: Added complexity and difficulty in managing the personas

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
