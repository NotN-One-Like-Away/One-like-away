# ADR-0003: Adoption of ESLint for Code Linting

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Need for a consistent and enforceable coding standard

## Decision
Use ESLint for code linting

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved code quality
- Consistent coding standard

### Negative
- Potential false positives and configuration overhead
- Dependence on ESLint's ecosystem

### Risks
- Over-reliance on automated linting
- Potential compatibility issues with existing tools

## Alternatives Considered
- **TSLint**: Less mature ecosystem and fewer integrations available
- **Prettier**: Less comprehensive linting capabilities

## Files Involved
- `eslint.config.js`
- `src/**/*`
