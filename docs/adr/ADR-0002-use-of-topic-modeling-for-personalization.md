# ADR-0002: Use of Topic Modeling for Personalization

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to accurately determine user preferences and interests led to the use of topic modeling.

## Decision
Use topic modeling to identify user preferences and interests.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved accuracy in determining user preferences
- Increased relevance of content
- Enhanced overall user experience

### Negative
- Increased complexity in the algorithm
- Potential for overfitting or underfitting

### Risks
- Difficulty in selecting the optimal topic modeling technique
- Potential for biased or discriminatory content

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a simple keyword-based filtering system**: This approach may not accurately capture user preferences and may lead to irrelevant content.
- **Use a collaborative filtering approach**: This approach may not be suitable for a small user base and may lead to cold start problems.

## Files Involved
- `src/pages/Feed.tsx`
- `src/pages/Graph.tsx`
