# ADR-0002: Enhancing Cluster Assignment Update

## Status
Proposed

## Context
To improve the responsiveness of the graph simulation to changes in node cluster assignments, an update mechanism was needed.

## Decision
Implement a mechanism to reheat the simulation when any node's cluster assignment changes.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved responsiveness of the simulation to cluster changes
- More dramatic and visible pull toward echo chambers

### Negative
- Potential increase in computational overhead
- Possible impact on simulation stability

### Risks
- Overly frequent reheat events could disrupt simulation performance

## Alternatives Considered
- **Updating cluster assignments only periodically**: Real-time updates provide a more engaging and interactive experience

## Files Involved
- `src/pages/Graph.tsx`
