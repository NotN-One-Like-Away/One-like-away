# ADR-0002: Introduction of Tailwind CSS

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need for a utility-first CSS framework for styling

## Decision
Use Tailwind CSS as the CSS framework

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development time
- Consistent and customizable styling

### Negative
- Steep learning curve
- Potential for over-engineering

### Risks
- Dependence on a third-party library
- Potential for compatibility issues

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a different CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI**: Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach was more suitable for the project
- **Use a custom CSS solution**: Increased development time and complexity

## Files Involved
- `package-lock.json`
- `package.json`
- `src/App.css`
- `vite.config.ts`
