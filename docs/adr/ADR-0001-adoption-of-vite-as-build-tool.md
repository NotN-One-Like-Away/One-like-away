# ADR-0001: Adoption of Vite as Build Tool

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Need for a fast and efficient build tool to enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and fast development

## Decision
Use Vite as the build tool

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development cycle
- Improved productivity

### Negative
- Steep learning curve for new developers
- Potential compatibility issues with existing tools

### Risks
- Dependence on Vite's ecosystem
- Potential performance issues with large projects

## Alternatives Considered
- **Webpack**: Slower development cycle and more complex configuration
- **Rollup**: Less mature ecosystem and fewer plugins available

## Files Involved
- `vite.config.ts`
- `package.json`
