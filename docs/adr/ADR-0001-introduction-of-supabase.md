# ADR-0001: Introduction of Supabase

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need for a backend-as-a-service to manage data and authentication

## Decision
Use Supabase as the backend-as-a-service

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simplified data management
- Easy authentication and authorization
- Scalability and reliability

### Negative
- Dependence on a third-party service
- Potential costs for large-scale applications

### Risks
- Data security and privacy concerns
- Dependence on Supabase's uptime and performance

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a custom backend solution**: Increased development time and complexity
- **Use another backend-as-a-service like Firebase or AWS Amplify**: Supabase's features and pricing were more suitable for the project

## Files Involved
- `package-lock.json`
- `package.json`
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`
