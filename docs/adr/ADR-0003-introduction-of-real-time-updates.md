# ADR-0003: Introduction of Real-time Updates

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to provide users with up-to-date content led to the introduction of real-time updates.

## Decision
Implement real-time updates to provide users with the latest content.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved user experience
- Increased engagement
- Enhanced overall user satisfaction

### Negative
- Increased load on the server
- Potential for decreased performance

### Risks
- Difficulty in handling high traffic
- Potential for errors or bugs

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a polling-based approach**: This approach may lead to decreased performance and increased load on the server.
- **Use a caching-based approach**: This approach may not provide the most up-to-date content and may lead to decreased user satisfaction.

## Files Involved
