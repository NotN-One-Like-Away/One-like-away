# ADR-0003: Changes to the Recommendation Algorithm

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to improve the recommendation algorithm to better simulate echo chambers and pull drifters into echo chambers organically

## Decision
Modified the recommendation algorithm to use a more aggressive affinity/recommendation approach, with a stronger echo chamber effect and more suppression of non-matching content

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved simulation of echo chambers
- More realistic drifter behavior

### Negative
- Potential for over-suppression of non-matching content

### Risks
- Potential for the algorithm to become too aggressive and result in unrealistic drifter behavior

## Alternatives Considered
- **Not modifying the recommendation algorithm and relying on the existing approach**: This approach would not effectively simulate echo chambers and would result in less realistic drifter behavior

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
