# ADR-0005: Redirection to Create Avatar Page

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The application required a way to redirect users to the create avatar page after introduction.

## Decision
Redirect users to the create avatar page after they have seen the introductory popup or if they are not logged in.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Streamlined user flow
- Reduced confusion for new users

### Negative
- Potential for users to feel forced into creating an avatar

### Risks
- Users may not understand why they are being redirected

## Alternatives Considered
- **Allow users to navigate to the create avatar page manually**: May lead to user confusion or frustration

## Files Involved
- `src/App.tsx`
