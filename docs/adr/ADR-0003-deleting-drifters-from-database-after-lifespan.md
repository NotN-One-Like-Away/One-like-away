# ADR-0003: Deleting Drifters from Database after Lifespan

## Status
Proposed

## Context
To maintain data consistency and prevent unnecessary data accumulation, drifters should be deleted from the database after their lifespan.

## Decision
Implement a mechanism to delete drifters from the database when their lifespan ends.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Maintains data consistency
- Prevents unnecessary data accumulation

### Negative
- Potential impact on database performance
- Possible issues with data retrieval

### Risks
- Data loss if deletion mechanism fails

## Alternatives Considered
- **Implementing a periodic cleanup task**: Real-time deletion provides more immediate data consistency and reduces the risk of data accumulation

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
