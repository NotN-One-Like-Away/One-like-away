# ADR-0001: Introduction of Drifter Seed Clusters

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to simulate echo chambers and introduce drifters with initial preferences towards specific topic clusters

## Decision
Introduced DRIFTER_SEED_CLUSTERS, a list of topic clusters that drifters can be seeded into, with each drifter getting a random seed that pulls them toward one echo chamber

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved simulation of echo chambers
- More realistic drifter behavior

### Negative
- Increased complexity in the drifter spawning process

### Risks
- Potential for uneven distribution of drifters across topic clusters

## Alternatives Considered
- **Randomly assigning drifters to topics without seed clusters**: This approach would not effectively simulate echo chambers and would result in less realistic drifter behavior

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
