# ADR-0001: Introduction of Personalized Feed

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to provide users with a more engaging and relevant experience led to the introduction of a personalized feed.

## Decision
Implement a personalized feed that takes into account user preferences and interests.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved user engagement
- Increased relevance of content
- Enhanced overall user experience

### Negative
- Potential for echo chambers
- Increased complexity in the algorithm
- Risk of decreased diversity in content

### Risks
- Difficulty in accurately determining user preferences
- Potential for biased or discriminatory content

## Alternatives Considered
- **Maintain a chronological feed**: This approach does not take into account user preferences and may lead to decreased engagement.
- **Use a simple keyword-based filtering system**: This approach may not accurately capture user preferences and may lead to irrelevant content.

## Files Involved
- `src/pages/Feed.tsx`
