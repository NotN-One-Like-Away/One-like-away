# ADR-0001: Implementation of UUID Validation for User IDs

## Status
Proposed

## Context
To prevent demo sessions from interfering with actual user sessions when Supabase is configured, a validation mechanism was needed to distinguish between demo and actual user IDs.

## Decision
Implement a UUID validation function to check if a user ID is a valid UUID, and clear demo sessions when Supabase is configured and an invalid demo ID is detected.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Prevents demo sessions from interfering with actual user sessions
- Ensures data integrity by clearing invalid demo sessions

### Negative
- May cause issues if the UUID validation function is not correctly implemented
- Could potentially clear valid user sessions if the UUID validation function is too restrictive

### Risks
- Incorrect implementation of the UUID validation function
- Incompatibility with future changes to the user ID format

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a different validation mechanism, such as checking for a specific prefix or suffix in the user ID**: UUID validation is a more robust and standardized approach to validating user IDs

## Files Involved
- `src/stores/userStore.ts`
