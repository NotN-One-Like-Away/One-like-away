# ADR-0001: Canonical Topic Normalization

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The system needed a way to group similar topics together to form echo chambers. This required a method to normalize topics to their canonical clusters.

## Decision
Implement a function to map any topic to its canonical cluster, allowing for more accurate echo chamber formation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved echo chamber formation
- More accurate topic clustering

### Negative
- Increased complexity in the botRunner.ts file

### Risks
- Potential for incorrect topic normalization

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a machine learning model for topic clustering**: Added complexity and potential for decreased accuracy

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
