# ADR-0001: Implementing Collision Force in Graph Simulation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
To prevent nodes from overlapping in the graph simulation, a collision force was needed to maintain a minimum distance between nodes.

## Decision
Implement a custom collision force function that adjusts node positions to prevent overlap.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved visual clarity of the graph
- Prevents node overlap

### Negative
- Increased computational complexity
- Potential impact on simulation performance

### Risks
- Overly aggressive collision force could disrupt simulation stability

## Alternatives Considered
- **Using a built-in collision force from a library**: Custom implementation provides more control over the simulation and better integration with existing code

## Files Involved
- `src/pages/Graph.tsx`
