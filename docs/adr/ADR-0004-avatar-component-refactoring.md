# ADR-0004: Avatar Component Refactoring

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Avatar component was refactored to improve its structure and maintainability.

## Decision
The decision was made to simplify the Avatar component by removing redundant code and introducing a more modular approach.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved code readability
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance and updates

### Negative
- Potential breaking changes for existing users
- Increased complexity in certain areas of the code

### Risks
- Introduction of new bugs or issues
- Incompatibility with certain browsers or environments

## Alternatives Considered
- **Leave the existing code as is**: The existing code was deemed too complex and difficult to maintain.
- **Introduce a new library or framework**: The decision was made to keep the codebase as lightweight as possible.

## Files Involved
- `src/components/Avatar.tsx`
- `src/components/AvatarBuilder.tsx`
