# ADR-0004: Introduction of Introductory Popup

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The application required a way to introduce new users to the app's purpose and functionality.

## Decision
Implement an introductory popup that appears when a user first opens the app, explaining the app's purpose and how to use it.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved user onboarding experience
- Increased user understanding of the app's purpose and functionality

### Negative
- Potential for users to find the popup annoying or intrusive

### Risks
- Users may not read or understand the introductory content

## Alternatives Considered
- **In-app tutorial or guided tour**: May be too lengthy or intrusive for some users
- **Contextual tooltips or hints**: May not provide a comprehensive introduction to the app's purpose and functionality

## Files Involved
- `src/App.tsx`
