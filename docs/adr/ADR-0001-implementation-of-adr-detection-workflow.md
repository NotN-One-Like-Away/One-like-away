# ADR-0001: Implementation of ADR Detection Workflow

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to automate the detection of architectural decisions in code changes

## Decision
Implement a GitHub Actions workflow to detect architectural decisions using AI models

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automated detection of architectural decisions
- Improved documentation of system structure and technology choices
- Enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members

### Negative
- Dependence on AI models and their potential biases
- Potential for false positives or false negatives in decision detection
- Additional complexity in the development workflow

### Risks
- Over-reliance on AI models
- Insufficient training data for AI models
- Potential security risks associated with API keys and secrets

## Alternatives Considered
- **Manual review of code changes**: Time-consuming and prone to human error
- **Implementation of a custom ADR detection tool**: Resource-intensive and potentially less effective than AI-powered solutions

## Files Involved
- `.github/workflows/ri-adr-detector.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ri-log-impact.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ri-pr-review.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ri-test-writer.yml`
- `.repo-intelligence/config.yml`
