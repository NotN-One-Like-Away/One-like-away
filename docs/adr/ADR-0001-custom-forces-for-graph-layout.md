# ADR-0001: Custom Forces for Graph Layout

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need for a more visually appealing and organized graph layout, with clusters forming naturally and nodes spread out

## Decision
Implement custom forces for the graph layout, including stronger repulsion between nodes, weaker link forces, and a custom clustering force

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved graph layout with more natural cluster formation
- Better node distribution and reduced overlap
- Enhanced visual appeal and usability

### Negative
- Increased computational complexity and potential performance impact
- Potential for over-repulsion or under-repulsion between nodes

### Risks
- Custom forces may not work as intended for large or complex graphs
- Potential for unintended side effects or interactions with other graph features

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a pre-built graph layout library or algorithm**: Custom forces are needed to achieve the desired layout and clustering behavior
- **Use a simpler force-directed layout algorithm**: Custom forces are needed to achieve the desired level of control and customization

## Files Involved
- `src/pages/Graph.tsx`
