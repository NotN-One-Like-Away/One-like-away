# ADR-0002: Implementation of Bot Topic Profiles

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The need to personalize bot interactions and create a more realistic simulation led to the implementation of bot topic profiles.

## Decision
Implement bot topic profiles to determine bot interactions and likes.

## Consequences

### Positive
- More realistic simulation of user interactions
- Ability to personalize bot interactions
- Improved recommendation algorithm

### Negative
- Additional complexity in the system
- Need for ongoing maintenance and tuning of bot topic profiles

### Risks
- Bot topic profiles may not accurately represent real user behavior
- System may become overly reliant on bot topic profiles for engagement

## Alternatives Considered
- **Use a simpler approach to determine bot interactions**: May not be realistic or engaging enough

## Files Involved
- `src/lib/botRunner.ts`
